Main difference between ethereum protocol and bitcoin protocol
Bitcoin have smart contracts but they are intentionaly turing incomplete
Bitcoin developer view bitcoin as a store of value 
Ethereum developer view ethereum as a store of value and have a utility of facilitate these decentralized aggreements 

To replace the everyday agreements with the smart contracts we need Blockchain must interract with the real world data 
Blockchain by themselves can't interact with the real world data
This problem is known as a Oracle Problem

Oracle are any device that deliver data to these decentralized blockchain or run external computation
if we want our application to stay truly decentralized then we cannot work with the single oracle or single data provider or a single source thats running these external computation
So we need decentralized oracle network similar to decentralized blockchain

Our On Chain logic will be decentralized but you need your off chain data and computation be decentralized

Combining on chain decentralized logic with the off chain decentralized data and decentralized computation give rise to something called hybrid smart contracts
